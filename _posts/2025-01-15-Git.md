## Git Add

After finishing new changes or edits in a project, include them in your Git version control by using the following command:

```sh
$ git add .
```

The `.` will add ALL files that have been changed. If, for example, you want to only add the changes to *one* file, you can do `git add [filename]` instead.


## Git Commit

To commit the changes to your repository (basically this means you are confirming that you want to keep the changes), you run the following the command:

```sh
$ git commit -m "A BRIEF MESSAGE ABOUT THE CHANGES"
```

## Git Commit

Once the changes are committed, to push the new code to your Github repository use the following command:

```sh
$ git push
```
