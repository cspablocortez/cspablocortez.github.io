What if I could blog from my word processor?

Word processors are arguably the best programs for writing. They come
packaged with everything necessary to produce professional documents.
Surely I could leverage one to blog?

I understand and love the appeal of using only markdown files, for
example, and relying purely on a terminal or a text editor to manage
text files, simplifying away any possible issues with file formatting or
software compatibility.

But writing with a word processor shouldn\'t be that bad. Here's what my
editor looks like:

It's also pretty easy to add images. The screenshot above, for example,
was simply dragged and dropped onto the document. No need to "upload" or
manage a separate image library.

But how do I take these .odt files and have them ready to be deployed
onto a website? I'm going to use a program called pandoc to convert this
into HTML. This almost worked. Looks like I will have to fix encoding,
because my apostrophes and quotes show up as nonsense.

Here is a small sentence written from the computer to see what it looks 
like once I publish.
