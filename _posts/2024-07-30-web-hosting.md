Some of the web development concepts we have reviewed in the past few lessons include:

- Static site generators
- Markdown
- YML
- CSS Flexbox
- Responsive Design


In the sections below you will find fill-in-the-blank text boxes. These will be **one word** responses.

## Client Meeting

A client arrives at your web development firm asking if you can help him. His idea is to build a website where people can see his reviews of different video games.

The first thing you asked him is if he had a name for the site. He said not yet, but he definitely wants his `_______` to end with `.com`.

<div style="visibility: visible;" class="lesson" data-answer="domain">
<input type="text" class="userInput" placeholder="Enter your code here">
        <button class="checkBtn" onclick="checkAnswer(this)"></button>
        <p class="feedback">
        </p>

</div>

Next you want to know what kind of site he wants. You ask him what type of content he plans on hosting, and he says he needs a `_______` (*web* + *log*) where he will write reviews but also display game images, screenshots, maybe even upload walkthrough videos, guides, maps, and tutorials. He says he wants something like IGN but much lighter and faster.

<div style="visibility: visible;" class="lesson" data-answer="blog">
<input type="text" class="userInput" placeholder="Enter your code here">
        <button class="checkBtn" onclick="checkAnswer(this)"></button>
        <p class="feedback">
        </p>

</div>

At this point you are pretty sure he wants a static site. Unlike a dynamic site, static sites have no databases or server-side processing. **A static site shows the same thing to every user.**

Since you have experience using the Jekyll static site generator, you tell the client you have just the right tool for the job, and after he thanks you for your time, you get to work. 

## Jekyll 




There are two things you should know when meeting with a 
prospective client if you are a web developer. We talked about 
the name of their website (**domain**) and the
type of app they are making and where it will be served from
(**hosting**). 

Besides hosting, you should know the website's `__________`.



Once you know the website's domain, you should learn more about
how you will handle the  `________`.

<div style="visibility: visible;" class="lesson" data-answer="hosting">
<input type="text" class="userInput" placeholder="Enter your code here">
        <button class="checkBtn" onclick="checkAnswer(this)"></button>
        <p class="feedback">
        </p>

</div>

One of the tools we have used is called Jekyll. Jekyll is a **static site generator**.
Would you use Jekyll for a **website** or a web **app**?

<div style="visibility: visible;" class="lesson" data-answer="website">
<input type="text" class="userInput" placeholder="Enter your code here">
        <button class="checkBtn" onclick="checkAnswer(this)"></button>
        <p class="feedback">
        </p>

</div>

4. The creator of Jekyll, Tom Preston-Werner, also created `_______`.

<div style="visibility: visible;" class="lesson" data-answer="github">
<input type="text" class="userInput" placeholder="Enter your code here">
        <button class="checkBtn" onclick="checkAnswer(this)"></button>
        <p class="feedback">
        </p>

</div>
