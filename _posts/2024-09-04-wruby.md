I read Giles Turnbull's thoughts on [gilest.org](https://gilest.org/indie-easy.html) about what independent web publishing in the style of the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org) needs:

> We need more self-hosted platforms for personal publishing that aren’t Wordpress. And don’t point me to Hugo or Netlify or Eleventy or all those things - all of them are great, but none of them are simple enough. We need web publishing tools that do not require users to open the Terminal at all. And we need lots of them.

It’s true. I spent some days this summer reading the Jekyll documentation and getting familiar with its suite of dependencies and conventions, from the syntax of its templating language to configuration options and global values.

Jekyll, like any static site generator, creates a local build of a website from markdown and other static files. The output is a build source directory ready for deployment, but there is also the option to integrate Github Actions if your Jekyll project has a Github repository. With this enabled, after committing and pushing changes to the main repository, Github runs an automatic build process that handles syncing files, building, and publishing the site.

At one point the project file structure starts looking something like this, although project structure varies from site to site.

As a programmer who has grown extremely fond of the Ruby programming language
and its community, learning all of this was fun. I learned so much about
the project and the Ruby software ecosystem. I watched tutorials on YouTube, talks at developer conferences. I read a bit on the history of each project. It was really cool to find out that Jekyll was built by 
[Tom Preston-Werner](https://tom.preston-werner.com), who also created GitHub. I learned Liquid was developed by Shopify and that the creator of 
[Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake), Jim Weirich, told the story of developing the project in 
the [initial keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D3KfnbTdWw) of RubyConf Uruguay 2011. 

While the developer part of me enjoys using this rich software ecosystem, the writer part of me feels an information overload every time I open a Jekyll project with a text editor.

It didn’t take long before I'd written scripts that automated tasks like creating new posts. The default way was to manually create markdown files that adhered to a specific filename format, and while this is helpful in processing posts since one of Jekyll's main features is having no database, it added one more layer of technology between writing and publication.

And the evidence is in the results. I didn’t upload more posts not because I didn’t keep writing, but because updating my Github Pages site required me to be simultaneously aware of the development and content of the project. Sometimes I want to spend time tweaking code files, but certainly not every time I need to write. I can't use technology that adds more steps to get from idea to draft and draft to deployment.

Jekyll and I have a conflict of interests. Jekyll is equipped to handle a huge variety of use cases. On the other hand, all I want is unobtrusive software that takes markdown files and delivers them through this website. It wouldn't be too difficult to automate the time consuming steps to keep using Jekyll.

But surely there’s more fun to be had in building a new thing from scratch.

In his article, Giles goes on to say:

> Let’s give people choices. Let’s give people options for tools they can set up and use, with no more knowledge than the knowledge they already have.

I came across a static site generator called [wruby](https://wruby.btxx.org) 
written by [Bradley Taunt](https://btxx.org). wruby synthesizes template 
language and build system into a Ruby file. Static site generator and 
blogging platform. All in one file!

It's a really cool idea.

I initially tested Bradley's static site generator on Termux, a terminal emulator for 
Android running on a tablet. I knew I had to try it in unlikely
environments when his [sourcehut repository]((https://git.sr.ht/~bt/wruby)) 
proudly claimed Ruby as its only dependency.

To get started, I ran `make build` and this installed any dependencies it needed 
([kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html) for markdown 
to html conversion and [rss](https://rubygems.org/gems/rss) for producing 
the rss feed). 

Ironically, there was an issue with the build, as the specified version
on the [inline Gemfile block](https://bundler.io/guides/bundler_in_a_single_file_ruby_script.html)
was 0.3.0 but my system had a more recent version (0.3.1). 

```ruby
require 'bundler/inline'
gemfile do
  gem 'kramdown', '2.4.0'
  gem 'rss', '0.3.0'
end
```

After fixing this with a quick edit in a text editor, I was able to get
the project built immediately. wruby generates a an output directory
(`build`) which contains a website, ready to be 
deployed.


```python
python3 -m http.server --directory build
```

I used the only one-liner command I can reliably recall for starting 
up a local server and the built site was served over port 8000. Awesome.

To start writing new content you must create new markdown files inside 
a `posts` folder, with no expected format for the filename. To modify
the content structure there are two HTML files, header and footer. 
Everything else is handled by `wruby.rb`, a program that in one file
declares several functions to parse markdown, concatenate HTML 
fragments and handle the reading and writing of files, including
an RSS feed. All of this built-in!

Following Bradley's footsteps, today I began work on a one-file static 
site generator tentatively called Arrow. The goal is to eventually handle
the maintenance of this website through it.

The work so far has been exploratory. I cloned the 
[wruby repository](https://git.sr.ht/~bt/wruby) and spent
most of today deploying a site created with wruby to Github Pages. I
programmed this process into a Rake task, moving away from 
[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to maintain the goal of
being platform agnostic.

Next, I'll be creating a Content Management System with Rake,
since it will be the simplest way to manage cross-platform repeatable tasks such
as creating a new post, building the site, and deploying to Github 
Pages. 

I'll leave the `config.yml` file alone, but I'll remove the need to
prefix an underscore since that's a Jekyll convention.

I expect to rewrite the entire application from scratch in the coming
days, but I wanted to mention Bradley's project 
first both for its influence on mine as well as to "give people options for tools they can set up and use". 
You can see some sites that are already using wruby [here](https://wruby.btxx.org/websites).

Its biggest contribution to the design of my 
static site generator will be its reminder of the 
[Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Origin).
wruby does one thing and it does it well. It takes a series of files
and outputs a folder ready to be deployed. 

For the deployment stage, I'll be relying on 
Github Pages for hosting. 

CMS will be handled through git and rake, while
site generation will be all Ruby with the fewest 
amount of dependencies possible.
