# App Idea

A job finder platform that helps people who are struggling to find a profession
they want to pursue find suitable options, maybe with a quiz or directory? Show
openings for those jobs, information and average pay for these jobs, and possibly 
and AI to ask more detailed questions.[^1]

[^1]: Evaluate people's answers


# Observations

- It's hard to make a decision because the options are separated by radio buttons.
- Questions are too context-dependent
- Hard to be honest with yourself because it could change at any moment
- Personality may be complex enough to include more than just the result given

# Test Format

1. Paginated questions
2. Checkbox answers
3. Sliders (snapping options)
4. Radio Buttons (vertical)
5. Radio Buttons (horizontal)
6. Choose 1 of 2
