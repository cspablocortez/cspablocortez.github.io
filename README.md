# Devlog

Before a README is finished I like devlogging through my dev process.

(19:21) Clearing out the project files from the old Jekyll site here, which used 
minima. 

(19:34) Empiezo con page.html para despu√©s abstraer default.html

(19:42) Breakthrough: working tailwind-style on each Jekyll "layout"

(20:04) I've separated default.html from page.html, helping with modularizing code.

(20:13) Needed to make a home.html to account for the blog posts feed

(21:01) Blockquotes look ok. Font-sizing remains unclear.

(21:17) Sample post ready for font styling.
