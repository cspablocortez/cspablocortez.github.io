    This book introduces you to Node, the new web development 
    framework written in JavaScript. You'll learn hands-on how 
    Node makes life easier for experienced JavaScript developers: 
    not only can you work on the front end and back end in the 
    same language, you'll also have more flexibility in choosing 
    how to divide application logic between client and server.

    Rails 7 completely redefines what it means to 
    produce fantastic user experiences and provides 
    a way to achieve all the benefits of single-page 
    applications - at a fraction of the complexity.
    Rails 7 integrates the Hotwire frameworks of
    Stimulus and Turbo directly as the new defaults, 
    together with that hot newness of import maps. 
    The result is a toolkit so powerful that it allows 
    a single individual to create modern applications upon 
    which they can build a competitive business. The way 
    it used to be.
