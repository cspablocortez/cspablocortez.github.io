    In the 90s, the Internet was like an independent
    country. Everything was so chaotic, vibrant and
    personal. Today, you are bound to few companies
    that put their rules in front of their users.
    
    The most sad thing is, people have forgotten 
    that they are creators, and they don't need someone
    to grant them that title.

    Just realised how often when working on some code 
    I will try to contact the original author based 
    on git blame... but in the future, a lot of those 
    people won't be around anymore. I think we usually 
    take for granted that people working on the same 
    project will be here - but in a couple of years 
    "anyone who worked on this module still alive?" may 
    be depressingly more common. Not even from the development 
    perspective, but working on the same thing as someone who's 
    not alive anymore. Apart from long-term or famous 
    construction projects, I can't think of many non-art places 
    where the author is preserved in the history so permanently 
    as in a source version control.

    MySpace was where you went in the past, WordPress and Movable 
    Type were where people went if they had the patience and writing 
    output to maintain a traditional blog, Facebook was where you went 
    to define yourself by schools and checkboxes, and Tumblr was where 
    you went to make your own identity and express your creativity.
