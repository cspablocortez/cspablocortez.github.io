    In the 90s, the Internet was like an independent
    country. Everything was so chaotic, vibrant and
    personal. Today, you are bound to few companies
    that put their rules in front of their users.
    
    The most sad thing is, people have forgotten 
    that they are creators, and they don't need someone
    to grant them that title.
